I'm definitely a bargain shopper—but I'm one who knows that there are some things you should never pay full price for, and other things that deserve a splurge. I always look for discounts when I’m buying clothes or shoes for example, but when it comes to something like my cell phone, I go all out. Decorating your apartments works the same way. Here are suggestions on where to save those pennies and where to splurge in your new place.

### Bedroom

**Splurge on your bed**. Some people can sleep on any bed and never have issues, but if you have back problems, are a light sleeper, or get too hot or cold, choosing the right bed can be the key to your happiness. These days there are lots of choices, including traditional spring mattresses or newer foam or latex mattresses, and some are adjustable, breathable and more. They’re not cheap, but if you spend the money, your own personal bed-Zen can be achieved.

**Save on** **sheets**. We’ve all been brainwashed by the concept of thread count. Is 200 just awful and 400 average? Should you go for 800 or 1,000 count Egyptian Cotton if I want the best sheets? What *is* thread count, anyway? Actually, thread count refers the number of threads woven together in a square inch. But according to [Consumer Reports](http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2013/09/higher-thread-count-doesn-t-guarantee-better-sheets/index.htm), once you get beyond about 400, it becomes more of a marketing ploy or creative thread math, than a difference you can feel.

### Greenery

**Splurge on real plants.** Don’t buy fake--just don’t. If you don’t have a green thumb but want to add some ambiance to your apartment, consider something easy, like succulents or cacti. They don’t require much care, and they look exotic and eye-catching in the right pot.

**Save on pots.** Thrift stores and garages sales are a great place to get big, ceramic pots that can cost a lot in some retail stores. If you prefer to buy new, go to the garden section of Wal-Mart or Target for a few expensive-looking pots of various sizes in the same color family.

### Television

**Splurge on your TV.** This can be an important part of the house for many people (yeah, I’m talking to the guys here), so go ahead and get what you really want, because I think you’ll regret it if you don’t. After you choose from LED, plasma, or LCD, look at size. Should you get 37, 42, or 50 inches… or more? I say splurge here and go big.

**Save** **on** **your TV**. Yes, you can do both. Manufacturers today have put great technology in the hands of bargain shoppers. Sure, your TV won't be a thrift store purchase, but even brand new you can get a good deal on a quality TV if you shop around and are wiling to skip a few features, like 3D or Smart TV.

### Furniture

**Splurge on a sofa** If you choose a well-made, quality couch it can last for years. Pick a classic style and neutral color so that it can be easily adapted to changes in your taste over the years.

**Save on accent pieces.** Stores like Ross, T.J. Maxx, Cost Plus World Market and others have creative, on-trend accessories, like throw pillows, lamps, rugs, and wall hangings at low enough prices that you can switch out your living room style on a whim. This gives you an inexpensive way to freshen up that well-made, neutral couch you splurged on.

So bargain shoppers, don't be afraid to splurge a little when it comes to decorating your place - put that wallet away and save a few bucks where you can. Take my advice, your apartment will look great!
