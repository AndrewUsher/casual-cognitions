Even if you’re on a shoestring budget, you can still add a flair of personality to your apartment with cool decor. You can substitute money for creativity and if you are willing to put in a little extra work, you can really create that wow factor on the cheap. Here are 5 tips to get you started on your transformation.

### Posters

Don’t dismiss this idea straight away. At least hear me out. Posters aren’t just for grungy teenagers to express their love of abstract musical genres. They provide a focal point for the room and can often spark a conversation. Posters come in all manner of designs from classy artwork to more modern and popular inspirational quotes. To give your room that extra touch of class, try framing your posters.

### Pallets

Furniture made from the timber of old forklift pallets is becoming increasingly popular. It’s now not uncommon to find pallet furniture in upmarket cafes and the fanciest of family homes. Best of all, the raw materials can usually be found for free. Now all that’s required is an injection of creativity and some basic woodwork skills.

### Paint

Changing the color of the walls of your room will have a remarkable effect on the overall appearance and also the mood of the room. This tip is of course only useful if you own the house you are decorating, or you have your landlord’s approval to paint the walls. However, if you have some old beaten-up furniture, you could give it a whole new lease of life with a coat of paint.

### Second Hand or Garage Sales

Get thrift shopping. In some of the larger second hand shops or garage sales, you’ll find a range of furniture and home decor at bargain prices. Purchasing second hand goods is a great way of getting high quality items that are in good condition, that other people have simply fallen out of love with.

### Throws and Rugs

You would be surprised at how much of a different look you can give a room by covering up old carpets and worn-down furniture. This works especially well with couches if you decorate them afterwards with some bright and scattered cushions.

Giving your room a makeover doesn’t need to be an expensive exercise. All it takes is to think outside the box and come up with your own charming and unique design. Get your creative hat on and see treasure where other people see trash.
