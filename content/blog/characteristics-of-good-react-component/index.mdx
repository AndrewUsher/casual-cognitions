1. “Single responsibility”
   A component has a single responsibility when it has one reason to change.

An fundamental rule to consider when writing React components is the single responsibility principle.

Single responsibility principle (abbreviated SRP) requires a component to have one reason to change.

A component has one reason to change when it implements one responsibility, or simpler when it does one thing.

A responsibility is either to render a list of items, or to show a date picker, or to make an HTTP request, or to draw a chart, or to lazy load an image, etc. Your component should pick only one responsibility and implement it. When you modify the way component implements its responsibility (e.g. a change to limit the number of items for render a list of items responsibility) - it has one reason to change.

Why is it important to have only one reason to change? Because component’s modification becomes isolated and under control.

Having one responsibility restricts the component size and makes it focused on one thing. A component focused on one thing is convenient to code, and later modify, reuse and test.

Let’s follow a few examples.

Example 1 A component fetches remote data, correspondingly it has one reason to change when fetch logic changes.
A reason to change happens when:

The server URL is modified
The response format is modified
You want to use a different HTTP requests library
Or any modification related to fetch logic only.
Example 2 A table component maps an array of data to a list of row components, as result having one reason to change when mapping logic changes.
A reason to change occurs when:

You have a task to limit the number of rendered row components (e.g. display up to 25 rows)
You’re asked to show a message “The list is empty” when there are no items to display
Or any modification related to mapping of array to row components only.
Does your component have many responsibilities? If the answer is yes, split the component into chunks by each individual responsibility.

An alternative reasoning about the single responsibility principle says to create the component around a clearly distinguishable axis of change. An axis of change attracts modifications of the same meaning.
In the previous 2 examples, the axis of change were fetch logic and mapping logic.
