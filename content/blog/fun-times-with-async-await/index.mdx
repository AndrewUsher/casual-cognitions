JavaScript is an event driven language. This means that JS will keep executing code while listening to other events.
Ok, I know, this may not sound so clear, so take an example:

```js
const one = () => {
  console.log(1);
}
  
const two = () => {
  console.log(2);
}

one();
two();
  
// => 1
// => 2
```

As you can see, JavaScript executes the functions above in order. But are you sure that it will wait until function `one` has terminated, before executing function `two`?

```js
const one = () => {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(1), 100);
}
  
const two = () => {
  console.log(2);
}

one();
two();
  
// => 2
// => 1
```
