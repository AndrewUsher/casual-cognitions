Hello, my name is Andrew Usher, and I'm a 19 year old web developer from Los Angeles, California. Here are some fun facts about me:

- I'm pretty tall! 6 foot 9 inches to be exact
- I played basketball in high school
- I'm pretty new to open source, and I've only had two pull requests accepted.

### Expertise/Interests

My expertise and interest lies in front-end technologies, including the building blocks like HTML, CSS, JavaScript . I have a little bit of experience using Node.js and Express particularly. I enjoy dabbling in mobile development and edge devices and environments. I've been learning the basics for a while, and I want to start getting more involved in open source. I believe that this will open a world of possibilities and rewards for other hard-working developers.

My learning process has always stayed the same: experiment, fail, fix, fail again, fix again, take a break, rinse and repeat. I've noticed that reading books and watching courses has only taken me so far -- spending time writing code, experimenting away with whichever technology I want to learn, and reading lots of documentation. Always keep an open mind, use tools you wouldn't usually use, and never give up.

### Other Hobbies

When I'm not immersed in the world of web development, I'm most likely playing Fortnite on Xbox. I also love to play old games on my PC, like Pokemon, Legend of Zelda, Golden Eye, Mario, and a lot of other classics. I also have a bike, and I ride ~6 miles everyday to stay in shape.

### Getting In Touch
