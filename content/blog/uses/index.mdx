This post details the things I use everyday, software or hardware. I'm looking forward to changing things up very soon, so I'll make sure I update this post. If there's anything I'm missing, you can let me know via any of my social media accounts and email.

### Editor + Terminal

- Visual Studio Code is my current editor which I have been using since December 2017. Before that, I was using Sublime Text.
- I switch between the Palenight and Cobalt2 themes.
- My font is currently Hack
- I switch between Git Bash and Hyper for my
  terminal
- I use Dev Tools Author for my Chrome Devtools

### Desktop Apps

- I use Text Expander for my canned responses and a majority of my code snippets.
- I use Trello and GTD for task management.
- I design in Figma and Adobe Illustrator.
- I do my writing in Caret.
- I use LiceCap to record.
- I just started using Polacode for code screenshots.
