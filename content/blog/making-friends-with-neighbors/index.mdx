Here’s the thing to know about neighbors: you will never know your neighbors, unless you introduce yourself. It’s as simple as that. Here are three ways to make friends with your neighbors without feeling like a complete weirdo:

### Food

People respond so well to food, that using it to your advantage almost feels like cheating. You can be bold and knock on your neighbor’s door with a plate of cookies in your hands, or you can leave a basket of fresh fruit from your patio garden and a note. Keep the note simple like, “Hello, from (name) in [apartment](http://www.apartments.com/) (apartment #). Welcome to the building!”

### Have a Small Party

If you’re outgoing enough to host a housewarming party with your neighbors, you’re ahead of the game. For the rest of you, don’t worry about trying to throw a party for strangers in your building, just throw a party for friends but extend an invite to the neighbors, too. It subdues all of the awkwardness (and pressure) out of the invite if you knock on their door. Should your guests get loud and stay late, neighbors are more likely to let it slide if they were invited and given a heads-up.

### Being Courteous

Actions like holding the door open, helping haul a stroller up the stairwell when the elevator is out of service, or making small talk in the communal laundry room are great for keeping things neighborly in the building. In big cities and small towns alike, having a friendly relationship with your neighbors helps you feel safer and happier at home – especially when that home is a rental.
