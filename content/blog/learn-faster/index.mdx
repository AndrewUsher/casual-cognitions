I've been doing web development for around a year now, but I've had some rough patches throughout this time. When I used to fail at creating projects, I would just delete everything and start over, or just stop coding altogether. These coding droughts occurred from time periods of a couple days all the way up to a month or two.

I used to see failure as a bad thing. However, as a developer, I have learned that I need to **embrace failure and discomfort**. Now, I don't look as failure as having to start over: it's a chance to do something better this time.

For example, let's say you want to create a full stack app in a day. If you're just starting out coding, that's not a realistic goal. It's not really specific either. However, if you set a unrealistic goal and fail, **learn from it**. Try again, fail again, and keep going. Even the best make mistakes: it's what you do after the mistake that counts!

What happens is we, as people and developers, fall into a cycle of discouragement. We mess up, then we beat ourselves up. As a result, we lose our motivation, and the cycle just repeats itself. **Break out of that cycle**. Look at every failure as an opportunity to start over and do things even better.
